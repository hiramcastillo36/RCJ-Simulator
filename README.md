# Bezier Curves for Robot Motion in RoboCup Soccer

The use of Bezier curves is proposed as a technique to define the motion trajectory of a robot in the soccer category of the RoboCup World Tournament. The primary objective is to guide the robot toward a specific point, typically represented by a ball, while avoiding obstacles. In this context, the main obstacle to be avoided is another robot placed randomly on the field.

The utilization of Bezier curves in this scenario offers a flexible and efficient means of planning the robot's movement. By defining control points along the path, the curve can be tailored to navigate around obstacles, ensuring a smooth and obstacle-free trajectory towards the target point.
